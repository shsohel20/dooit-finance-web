/**
 * KYB Intake — Business verification intake wizard.
 * React port of docs/kyb-ui-design/project/"KYB Intake Form.dc.html" (6 steps:
 * Entity / Addresses / Ownership & control / People / Documents / Review),
 * per user request to follow the design bundle's visual style (docs/65 log).
 *
 * Deliberate deviations from the prototype, all standing decisions:
 * - No "ASIC document no." fields and no fake "Matched to ASIC/ABR" verified
 *   badges — no registry integration exists, so a permanent tick would lie,
 *   and ASIC-filing fields were dropped from the model entirely.
 * - "Jurisdiction" is a plain country dropdown (the same shared country list
 *   used everywhere else in the app), not the mockup's bespoke combined
 *   "State, Country" strings — it feeds general_information
 *   .country_of_incorporation directly, the document's sole country field.
 * - Registry identifiers are one dynamic list matching identifiers[] on the
 *   model directly (Type/Value/Jurisdiction rows), not fixed named inputs —
 *   the form follows the schema's shape, not the mockup's field layout.
 *
 * Submit POSTs to /customer/company (the writer added alongside this
 * rebuild), then routes to the KYB Review dossier for the new record.
